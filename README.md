# 4-Bit Full Adder Using CMOS Logic (SCL 180nm PDK)
## Overview

This project implements a **4-bit full adder** using basic CMOS logic gates (AND, OR, XOR), manually connected to form a **ripple-carry adder**. All simulations were carried out using **Cadence Spectre** with a 1.8V supply and **SCL 180nm standard cells**. Delay metrics and transient analysis validate the design.

## Delay Metrics

| Path           | Gate Composition            | Delay (ps) |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| A → Sum        | XOR → XOR                   | ~271.7     |
| Cin → Cout     | XOR → AND → OR              | ~310+      |

> **Critical Path**: `Cin → Cout`  
> **Sum Path Delay** corresponds to contamination delay  
> Delay computed using **Spectre markers and waveform measurements**

## 📐 Physical Design Readiness (Next Steps)

While this project covers the full schematic design flow, the next planned steps include:

-  Layout design in **Virtuoso Layout Editor**
-  DRC/LVS verification using **Assura or Calibre**
-  Parasitic extraction (PEX)
-  Post-layout delay analysis
-  GDSII export

> This will help transition this 4-bit adder from functional design to silicon-ready block.
